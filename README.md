## Introduction

The following is a list of development tools I either use, or I am keeping an eye on.

Unlike most "awesome-foo" lists, this is not a list of every library available for a certain platform you can find on Github, but rather a small list of the ones I use or I would pick if starting a new project.

This means I expect certain attributes like completeness, potential, licensing (eg. avoid GPL'ed libraries, prefer MIT/BSD, then LGPL), documentation, examples, ability to build and package, etc.

## Configuration

- C
  - [libucl](https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl) - Universal configuration library parser 

## Dependency management

- Go
  - [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) - Go dependency management tool


## Logging

- Go
  - [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) - Structured, pluggable logging for Go. 

## Multimedia

- C
  - [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/) - cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics.

### UI Toolkits, graphics

- C
  - [Nuklear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear) - A single-header ANSI C gui library

### Text-mode UI, terminal

- C++
  - [finalcut](https://github.com/gansm/finalcut) - A text-based widget toolkit.
- Go
  - [clui](https://github.com/VladimirMarkelov/clui) - Command Line User Interface (Console UI inspired by TurboVision)
  - [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview) - Rich interactive widgets for terminal-based UIs written in Go
- Java
  - [jexer](https://github.com/klamonte/jexer) - Java Text User Interface, inspired by TurboVision. Impressive. No trillion dependencies, even builds with ant.
